Overview
-<?php .... ?>
- __ symbols are "magical" e.g. __autoload()
-use clone to copy a value e.g. $end = clone $start;
-magic class methods
--constructor method is __construct, call parent(super) using parent::__construct()
--clone method is __clone
--can make these private to prevent them from being called directly
-return signature is function [fname](): [return value(s)]
-keyword use as an include
-prefixing a variable with ? means it can be null e.g. ?String stringvar = null;
-variables prefixed with $ e.g. $var
--can use $$ syntax to access a var or method or class using a string e.g. $value ="val"; $varname="value"; echo $$varname; // prints 'val'

Arrays
-weakly typed
-defined as 'array' e.g. private array elements; or function getArray() : array;
-can have associative arrays (dictionary/map)
--ex:
--$user_list = array(
    'dave' => 'apassword',
    'steve' => 'secr3t'
  );
-in_array method can determine if a value exists in an array
-convert a single arg to an array e.g. $this->visited[] = $role; // $role is a single object
--can also use this syntax to append to an array
-can access elements using either [] or {} syntax
-if you define an array without using [], e.g. $var = array() then you get an associative array (like a map)
--to get an indexed array you must use the [] = form e.g. $var[] = array()
-destructure arrays using list or []
--[$id,$value] = $idValueArray;
--list($id,$value) = $idValueArray;

Loops
-for written in standard notation e.g. for ($i=0; $i < 5; $i++)
-foreach allows iterating e.g. foreach($characters as $char)
-foreach returning a specific value e.g. foreach ($user_list as $user => $pass)
--or used to grab index and value from a normal array e.g. $foo = [1,2,3]; foreach($foo as $i => $value) ... where $i is index and $value is the value at that index

Namespaces
-namespaces are used to define unique pathways to files to eliminate collisions (https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)
--ex namespace hey\ho\lets\go
-to access items in the global namespace, use the \ operator e.g. function fopen() { \fopen()} to call the global fopen if we overrode it for some reason
--Exception class needs to be escaped in a namespaced class
-be sure to put namespace declaration at top of file, before any use statements

CLI
-access to command line via $argc and $argv $argv[1] = filename
-exit([error code])

Dependency Management
-two options, Composer and PEAR. Composer seems to be the flavor of the day
-composer install to install specified items with the versions provided in the .lockfile
-composer update to update, don't use this in production because you might get different versions than the .lock file

Printing info to screen
-Use var_dump to print a value as well as a minimal stack trace showing the line the print came from

Operators/Symbols (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3737139/reference-what-does-this-symbol-mean-in-php)
-==/!= is non strict, will return true if truthy or one value can be coerced into the other, e.g. 5 == '5'  or 0 == false or null == false
-===/!== is strict, match on type and value
-NAN is the only thing that is always false in comparison to other things except the value true (weird...)
-standard ternary op [condition] ? [truth value] : [false value]
-shortcut ternary op [condition] ?: [false value] returns condition if it evalues to true so $x > 0 ? $x : null -> $x ?: null
-"=>" is used like a ":" in ruby for setting key/value pairs
-"@" operator can be used to override default exception behavior e.g. echo @$foo['bar'] does nothing if foo['bar'] doesn't exist

Null tests
-gettype() returns NULL if undefined or set to NULL explicitly
-empty() returns true if the length of something is 0 (or NULL), e.g. "", array(), var $x, 0 are all "empty"
-is_null() returns true if gettype returns NULL
-isset() returns true for anything that is defined, isset() === !is_null()

Switch statements
-perform an == (truthy) comparison and therefore are not type strict
-break or return is required unless you want to run subsequent cases
-ex (match for 3 runs default as well)
--case 1: ... break;
--case 2: ... break;
--case 3: ...
--default:

Strings
-concatentation operator is '.' e.g. "Hi"."there"."how"."are"."you" => Hitherehowareyou
--has same precedence as + operator, e.g. echo "result: " . $var + 3 => 3
--can concat numbers this way e.g. 1 . 2 => 12 but 1.2 => 1.2 !
-can use concat assign as '.='
-for long string constants use concat, not concat assign to break up the string across multiple lines
-can concat using interpolation e.g. "Name is ${name}". Only works with double quotes
-single quote strings are literals and no attempts to process special characters or variables are made
-can intermix single and double quote e.g. 'Hello ' . "$person" . ' how are you today?' . "\n"
-Nowdoc syntax allows multi-line initialized and terminated by an EOD marker on its own line e.g. $str = <<< 'EOD' // note triple chevron <<<
--does not parse interpolation or special characters
-heterodoc syntax is the same as nowdoc but processes special chars (like a double quote)
-use is_string method to test if something is actually a string
--use ctype_digit to check if any of the characters are numeric
---other ctype functions exist
--use is_int to check if the string can be coerced into an int

Design patterns
-taken from https://designpatternsphp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html
-don't use static methods/classes because they cannot be mocked easily for unit testing

DateTime
-DateTime objects cannot be coerced into strings, must explicitly convert using the format method
--there are many standard formats defined in DateTimeInterface https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetimeinterface.php#datetime.constants.types

Observer/Subject
-built in classes SplObserver and SplSubject allow for decoupled interchanges ala message queues

Databases
-PDO is an abstraction interface so you don't have to worry about vendor or drivers
-provides a way to filter input, escaping harmful characters, and restricting values to a defined type e.g. PDO::PARAM_INT
-free up connection resources by destorying the connection and set the variable to null so it can be garbage collected

Exceptions
-handled the java way e.g. try catch finally
-can catch multiple exceptions using the pipe | operator e.g. catch(ExceptionOne $1 | ExceptionTwo $2)
-finally is always executed, even if a try or catch block issues a return statement
-can create a global handler using set_exception_handler() to define a global catch block, could be used for logging or to increase/decrease the severity of an exception

Static methods
-referenced using ClassName::method
-if a static method references self:: then it will only use its implementation, not a sub class
--to reference a static method in a subclass (overridden) use static::

Security
-https://phpsecurity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html#yet-another-php-security-book
-https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/
-don't trust html5 form validators because a hacker could just falsify a post request that bypasses the view layer
--makes sense to log these kinds of validation violations because they indicate a malicious intent since in normal use it should never happen
-always check type as well as value because php is not strongly typed
-php provides data filtering functions: https://www.php.net/book.filter
--use filter_var([val],[validation type],[options]) to filter a variable's value
--use filter_input([filter type],[value]) to filter input from forms
-be sure to verify the identity of a server we want to trust using a certification authority
-be careful when deserializing data

Traits
-means of bundling functionality a-la a class but not part of a class hierarchy
--traits can compose other traits
-cannot implement interfaces
--directly but the methods in a trait can be used to satisfy an interface
-can have abstract methods which a 'using' class must implement
-can define static methods and members
--static methods/members not shared with other classes or class instances that use the trait
-can define properties (class scope variables)
--if using class has a property of the same name it must have same visibility and initial value
-kind of like implementing an interface except the trait implements the interface for you
-enables a form of composition without having delegate methods or multiple class inheritance
--we could just use an instance variable of another class then have methods that mirror the methods of the instance variable but this is complicated, confusing and difficult to maintain
-Traits cannot be instantiated, only used
--use [traitname]; or multiple use trait1,trait2, etc...;
---can specify namespace as well though this takes from the root of the namespace of the class using it
--if there are conflicts/collisions of attributes then specify which one you want via  { trait1::method insteadof trait2;}
--can alias a method name using {trait2::method as othermethod; }
--can alter visibility using [methodname] as protected/private/etc...
-class which "uses" a trait can access trait functionality as thought it were its own
--ex: trait A { getThing() {} }, class B { use A; }, new B()->getThing();
-methods in a trait can be overridden
-trait methods take precedence over methods inherited in a parent class
-final keyword is ignored
-can access variables in the using class, regardless of scope
-use is a lot like a require or a partial which is inserted into the class "magically" by the runtime environment
--this insert is a snapshot of the state at the time so if a static var changes later it will not affect any earlier insertions

Why traits
-can be used to compose common concepts
-examples
--readonly trait that comes with getters/setters and a flag
--iteratable object
--loggable object, call $object->log() instead of $logger->log(object) ??
---or allow the class to call log itself without having a logger injected (thought it must be injected into the trait?)
--event generation?
-use parent classes for functionality that’s intrinsic to what the object is.
-share common object mocks among testcases
-color trait for a shape
-use traits to wrap other objects for which you only want a subset of methods (but why not make each of the methods a trait?)
