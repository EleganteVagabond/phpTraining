Factories
-separate business logic from construction of things
-factories contain switch/if statements that can vary what gets created based on what the user wants
-this requires more polymorphism, e.g. creating subclasses that do one specific task.
--might be many small files
-can really improve speed because less branching and if conditionals are set as global flags at startup then modern jvms will eliminate the branching and inline the bytecode
