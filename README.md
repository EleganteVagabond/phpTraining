# PHP Training

I needed to learn `PHP` for a new job at `BambooHR` and used a `PHP 7.3` training courtesy of [PHP The Right Way](phptherightway.com).

I also utilized the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) prompts for 2020 and various [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com/challenges/) challenges to further practice.

See the various `.learning-` files to glimpse what I learned through my `PHP` journey
